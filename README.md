> Simple HTML Boilerplate by anotherblankface

### Tutorial
It's a pretty simple set up, make sure to direct the pre-setup script and link tags to your respective files. Also make sure to update the meta tags as they are very useful, see the link below if you are unsure about what they do. Feel free to contact me if you need any help on my [Twitter/@antherblankface](https://twitter.com/antherblankface)
